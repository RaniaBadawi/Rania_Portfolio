# [Project 1: AudioTranslate: Automatic Speech Recognition and Translation](https://github.com/MohamedeEssam/automatic-speech-recognation)

AudioTranslate is a project designed to transcribe audio recordings into text and translate them into multiple languages. The goal of this project is to make communication more accessible by providing seamless and accurate transcription and translation services. Our system allows users to either upload audio files or record directly via the web app, where the audio is processed and converted to text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, followed by translation into the selected language.

# [Machine-Learning-for-User-Classification-Project](https://github.com/RaniaBadawi/Machine-Learning-for-User-Classification-Project)
This project aims to predict whether students on an online education platform will upgrade from a free plan to a paid plan based on their engagement metrics. By utilizing data such as days on platform, content-watched minutes, and courses started, I trained and evaluated several machine learning models to identify the most effective one for this classification task.
