# Project 1: AudioTranslate: Automatic Speech Recognition and Translation

AudioTranslate is a project designed to transcribe audio recordings into text and translate them into multiple languages. The goal of this project is to make communication more accessible by providing seamless and accurate transcription and translation services. Our system allows users to either upload audio files or record directly via the web app, where the audio is processed and converted to text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, followed by translation into the selected language.
